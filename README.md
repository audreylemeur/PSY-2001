This repository contains notes and examples for PSY 2001 - Research Methods in Psychology during Fall 2020 at the University of Minnesota Morris.

## Regression and Other Stories - Data and code

The repository was forked from the git repository from our text: Regression and Other Stories. The following is the description for that repository:

> Regression and Other Stories by [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), [Jennifer Hill](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/jennifer-hill), and [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) (2020)
>
> [Regression and Other Stories book home page](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/regression/)
>
> This git repository has data and code for the examples and exercises in the book. Most of the examples are ready, but some examples are not yet finished and will be updated before the publication of the book. Some examples are waiting new features in the next release of [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/) and some outputs of [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/) will change in the next release of rstanarm. If you find any errors in code please make an issue or email [Aki.Vehtari@aalto.fi](mailto:Aki.Vehtari@aalto.fi).
