## Exponential

The following is a plot of ten points in exponential model.

```{r}
x = seq(1:10)
plot(x, exp(x))
```

## Logarithmic

Now, let's plot the inverse: a logarithmic model.

```{r}
x = seq(1:10)
plot(x, log(x))
```

## Practical Example

Let's use the example of the sleep study from last class.

```{r}
library(lme4)
d <- sleepstudy
plot(Reaction~Days, data=d)
abline(coef(lm(Reaction~Days, data=d)))
```

Now, let's put the data through a logarithmic translation.

```{r}
library(lme4)
d <- sleepstudy
plot(log(Reaction)~Days, data=d)
abline(coef(lm(log(Reaction)~Days, data=d)))
```

Notice how the data has less variance after the logarithm is applied.
