## Weighed Averages

First, read the data from the table and summarize the data frame.

```{r read}
d <- read.table("weighted.txt", header=TRUE)
str(d)
```

Next, let's look at a specific vector using $. We can also manipulate that vector just like real numbers.

```{r vector}
d$n_trial
d$n_trial/90
```

Now, we can assign a new column to our original data frame using that vector manipulation.

```{r}
d$w <- d$n_trial/90
```
