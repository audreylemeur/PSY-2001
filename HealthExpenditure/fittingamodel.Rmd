```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Reading a Table

First, we want to read the data from the file. To do that, we will use the method read.table:

```{r read}
healthdata <- read.table(file = "data/healthdata.txt", header = TRUE)
head(healthdata)
```

* if you're curious on how to take in text, look at the very first ROAS example for scatterplots.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
