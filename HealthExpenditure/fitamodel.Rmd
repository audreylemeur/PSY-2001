```

## Reading a Table

First, we want to read the data from the file. To do that, we will use the R method read.table:

```{r read}
healthdata <- read.table(file = "data/healthdata.txt", header = TRUE)
head(healthdata)
```

* if you're curious on how to take in text, look at the very first ROAS example for scatterplots.

## Plot the Data

Next, we will the plot the data that we read from the table:

```{r plot}
plot(lifespan~spending, data=healthdata)
```

## Fit the Model

Last, we will fit the data to a linear model. To do this, we will use the R method lm:

```{r fit}
m1 <- lm(lifespan~spending, data=healthdata)
summary(m1)
```
